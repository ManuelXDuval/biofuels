title: "Biomass-based Diesel: the prospect"

- In 2026, the U.S. consumes roughly 3.7 to 3.8 million barrels of diesel per day. To replace this with renewable diesel (RD), here is how one can structure en estimation.

1. The Consumption Target
  - Converting the daily barrels into an annual volume in gallons:  
      + Daily: $3.75 \text{ million b/d}$  
      + Annual: $\approx 57.5 \text{ billion gallons per year}$  
  
2. The Biomass Feedstock sources:  
 - Renewable diesel is made via hydrotreating, which requires specific fats and oils (lipids) or, in advanced scenarios, "lignocellulosic" biomass (wood/stalks) via pyrolysis.  
 
 A. Lipids (Soybean Oil, Corn Oil, Tallow)
  - This is the current industry standard. The conversion is highly efficient because the feedstock is already an oil.

    + Yield: It takes roughly 7.5 to 8.0 lbs of oil to produce 1 gallon of renewable diesel. 
    + To replace all U.S. diesel, roughly 450 billion lbs of fats/oils would be needed.
