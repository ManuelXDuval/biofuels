<b>Research and analysis of biomass-based diesel as potential cost-effective energy sources.</b>

# Plant-based source of energy: energy crops

-   Three main types of bio fuels:
    -   ethanol;
    -   renewable natural gas (RNG aka biomethane);
    -   alkanes (Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and biomass based diesels, which include Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel);

-   Unlike petroleum diesel, biomass-based diesel significantly reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Because the plants used for feedstock (like soybeans or canola (aka Rapeseed)) absorb $CO_2$ as they grow, the cycle is much closer to carbon neutrality than fossil-fuel-based alternatives.
