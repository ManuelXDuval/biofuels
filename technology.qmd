## Understanding the Conversion Process

Biomass-based diesel (biodiesel) is a renewable, biodegradable fuel manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant grease. The transition from raw organic feedstock to high-quality fuel involves a precise chemical process known as **Transesterification**.

### The Chemistry: Transesterification

The primary components of biomass oils are **Triglycerides**. During the transesterification reaction, these triglycerides are reacted with an alcohol (typically methanol) in the presence of a catalyst.



**The Reaction Formula:**
$$\text{Triglyceride} + 3 \text{CH}_3\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{Catalyst}} \text{Glycerol} + 3 \text{FAME (Biodiesel)}$$

1.  **Reactants:** Triglycerides + Methanol (3:1 molar ratio).
2.  **Catalyst:** Usually Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) or Potassium Hydroxide (KOH).
3.  **Outputs:** **Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME)**, which is the chemical name for biodiesel, and **Glycerol**, a valuable byproduct used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.
