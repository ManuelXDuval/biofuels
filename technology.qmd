# Biodiesel and Renewable diesels production concepts   

## Biodiesel

Biodiesel is manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant grease. The transition from raw organic feedstock to high-quality fuel involves a precise chemical process known as **Transesterification**.

### The Chemistry: Transesterification

The primary components of biomass oils are **Triglycerides**. During the transesterification reaction, these triglycerides are reacted with an alcohol (typically methanol) in the presence of a catalyst.



**The Reaction Formula:**
$$\text{Triglyceride} + 3 \text{CH}_3\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{Catalyst}} \text{Glycerol} + 3 \text{FAME (Biodiesel)}$$

1.  **Reactants:** Triglycerides + Methanol (3:1 molar ratio).
2.  **Catalyst:** Usually Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) or Potassium Hydroxide (KOH).
3.  **Outputs:** **Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME)**, which is the chemical name for biodiesel, and **Glycerol**, a valuable byproduct used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

## Renewable Diesel (aka Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO))
  
While FAME biodiesel is an ester, HVO is a pure paraffinic hydrocarbon. It is produced through a process called **Hydrotreating**, which is similar to the technology used in traditional petroleum refineries to remove sulfur.

### The  Hydrotreating Technology  
In this process, the feedstock (fats and oils) is reacted with Hydrogen ($H_2$) at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst. Unlike transesterification, hydrotreating removes all oxygen from the oil molecules.  
The Reaction Steps:  
 - **Hydrogenation**: Saturation of double bonds in the fatty acid chains.  
 - **Deoxygenation**: The oxygen atoms are stripped away and released as water ($H_2O$) or carbon dioxide ($CO_2$).  
 - **Isomerization**: The straight hydrocarbon chains are "branched" to improve the fuel's cold-weather performance (lowering the cloud point).    
   
 **Key Advantages of HVO**  
 - Drop-in Capability: because it contains no oxygen, HVO can be used as a $100\%$ replacement for petroleum diesel without any engine modifications.  
 - Storage Stability: it is highly resistant to oxidation and does not attract water, giving it a much longer shelf life than FAME biodiesel.  
 - Cold Flow: Isomerization allows HVO to remain liquid at much lower temperatures than standard biodiesel.
